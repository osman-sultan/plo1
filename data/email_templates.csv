Refund Process (General),"Hello!\n\nSorry to hear that it's not working out. A return is definitely possible.\n\nThe process is simple. We provide you with a shipping label.

Once we get the parts back in our shop, we will make sure everything is in good working order and then provide you with a full refund, less the cost of shipping it back to me $[SHIPPING COST].\n\nIf that sounds good, we can get things started.\n\nBest,\nPloopy Corporation"
PMW Soldering Fault Explanation,"Hello! And thanks for supporting the shop!\n\nAt Ploopy, we rigorously test every board that is sent out. Absolutely nothing that we ship is untested, so if we ship it, it has passed our testing standards, which are quite high as we use our products ourselves and want others to experience our products the way that we experience them.\n\nMany potential problems can occur during soldering, which can cause the sorts of issues that you're seeing now. One particularly common issue stems from the fact that the PMW-3360 has a plastic chip carrier that has a very low melting point. This means that it is quite sensitive to excessive heat, which can cause deformations in the chip carrier. These deformations can cause the chip to suddenly stop functioning, even after a period of successful usage.\n\nAnother is improper connections, which can be caused by a number of defects during the soldering process. We always recommend this video to customers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpkkfK937mU It correctly shows how to avoid common issues like cold joints, excessive or not enough solder, and how and when to use flux. We watch it regularly to refresh our own skills, so it's a great watch even if you're already an expert.\n\nIn these sorts of situations, we always recommend revisiting the soldering job. It can be surprising how simple soldering defects can hide behind joints that look perfectly acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if the board is otherwise functional and just the sensor is non-functioning, we can look into providing you with a replacement after you've successfully desoldered the original chip. The chips themselves cost $24CAD, plus shipping to you. Also, you can find a great video on through-hole desoldering here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z38WsZFmq8E.\n\nHopefully that provides you with some info on how we do things, soldering in general, and your options.\n\nBest,\nPloopy Corporation"
International Air (Untracked) Shipping Option Explanation (General),"Hello! And thanks for supporting the shop!\n\nWhen you made your order, you selected the shipping option of ""International Air (Untracked)"". This means that your shipping does not have any tracking information.\n\nFurthermore, we unfortunately don't have any kind of access to shipping information. If we did, we would gladly share it with you.\n\nThat being said, while not common, packages occasionally get stuck during the shipping process. In my experience, the package almost always gets delivered, though it sometimes takes a bit longer than advertised.\n\nBest,\nPloopy Corporation"
Track Ball Colours Unavailability (General),"Hello!\n\nWe receive our balls from a billiard ball supplier in large quantities. The makeup of them is split into mostly reds, but there are other colours in the mix as well. We typically sell down our stocks of the other colours first, leaving red (as the majority) left at the end. As we sell down our stocks, we adjust what's on our website to show what's available. Hopefully, that gives you a better idea of how things are run in the background.\n\nWe're currently exploring options with other ball suppliers, but we don't have specific timelines for what colours will be available, and when. It's all a bit up in the air, we are sorry to say.\n\nBest,\nPloopy Corporation"
Shipping Delays Explanation (General),"Hello! And thanks for supporting the shop!\n\nWhile not common, packages occasionally get stuck during the shipping process. Despite that, the package almost always gets delivered, though it sometimes takes a bit longer than advertised.\n\nIf it still hasn't been delivered two weeks from now, circle back and we'll see what we can do. And don't worry, no matter what happens, you'll be made whole. You paid for something, and you're going to get it.\n\nBest,\nPloopy Corporation"
